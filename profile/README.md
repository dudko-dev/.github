## My participation:

## Sommsation

 As a member of the Remedy team, I had the privilege of serving as a software architect on a transformative project for two years. During this time, I played a key role in collaboratively and independently crafting detailed roadmaps for new business features, steering their implementation, and actively contributing to their development. Under my guidance, a sophisticated system for discounts and promotions was meticulously designed and brought to life, alongside a transactional gift card service that enhanced customer engagement. I also pioneered the creation of a robust monitoring system to identify and address errors and performance bottlenecks, ensuring operational excellence. Through targeted performance optimizations, I successfully reduced response times by several magnitudes, significantly improving user experience. Additionally, I spearheaded the integration of a custom authorization service into Postman, overcoming its native limitations. My responsibilities extended to documenting APIs and leading the testing team in validating critical business features, ensuring quality and reliability at every stage.

## Customer testimonials:

Siarhei is one of the most complete software architectural thinkers I have ever worked with and is also a pleasure to work with!

  
[Joey Lamusga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeylamusga), Product Manager @ Sommsation

I had the pleasure of working with Sergey for five years at Remedy Product, during which he grew from a senior engineer into a trusted and capable tech lead. As Head of Product, I collaborated closely with Sergey across multiple projects, including Vend Park. I consistently relied on his diligence and technical skill to bring complex ideas to life.  
  
Sergey is a reliable and hardworking engineer. He approaches every challenge with care and professionalism, and he leads with both competence and kindness. Beyond his technical contributions, he’s a team player who brings loyalty, integrity, and a steady presence to any team he's on.  
  
Any organization would be lucky to have Sergey.

  
[Igor "Iggy" Moliver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igormoliver), Product + Investments @ Remedy Product Studio

Sergey worked closely with Vend Park via Remedy Point Solutions. Over the course of about 2 years, he implemented a lot of our core backend functionality. Sergey's communication was incredible, and he was able to fully understand intricate business requirements and convert them to reliable and scalable code.   
  
 Specifically he demonstrated proficiency across a variety of Google Cloud Platform tools, built a robust and scalable serverless backend, helped with data migrations and one-off user requests, and was always available for emergencies even over weekends. He led several projects including (for example) the implementation of complex pricing algorithms working across timezones and DST, as well as hierarchical application of parking passes and time-based parking rates specific to each garage and each user.   
  
 Overall, I really admire Sergey's attitude and approach to problem-solving. He is much more than a typical backend developer - he is someone your team can count on as a backend lead that spans everything from project planning through to detailed implementation and maintenance. In addition, he provided oversight and acted as the team lead for about 6 engineers spread between mobile and web technologies.   
  
 Thank you for your hard work Sergey!

  
[Karan Singhal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karansinghal), Founder, CTO @ Vend Park | Forbes 30u30 Boston

[Yuri Kazliak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuri-kazliak-557107193), Full Stack Developer | Team Lead

I feel very lucky to have worked with Sergey and I want to sincerely recommend him.  
  
Sergey is an incredibly strong backend developer and architect, and a true driver of the team. His expertise and experience help not only to solve complex tasks but to do so in the most effective way. If Sergey notices a problem, he never just points it out — he always suggests a solution. What’s more, he has the rare ability to see potential pitfalls and risks at the earliest stages of a feature’s discussion or development, which saves the team a huge amount of time and effort.  
  
I especially appreciate his willingness to share knowledge. Every call with Sergey feels like a mini masterclass: he doesn’t just explain the task, he helps you truly understand the bigger picture. Over two years of working side by side, I’ve learned more about API testing from him than I did in several years of independent practice.  
  
Sergey is that rare kind of professional who combines strong technical expertise with kindness, willingness to help, and real team spirit. Working with him is a great pleasure and a big advantage for any company.

  
[Volha Zhuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/volha-zhuk-qa), Quality Assurance Engineer

I have worked with Sergey on several projects, and each time he has proven to be an invaluable team member. He consistently shows genuine interest in the success of the project, contributes ideas for improvement, and maintains a strong focus on the quality of his work. Sergey is an outstanding professional, capable of solving complex problems and building well-designed, scalable features, all while ensuring product stability and security.  
  
He is highly structured, well-organized, and always willing to share his knowledge, actively supporting the professional growth of the entire team. Having such a exceptional engineer on the team is a real privilege, and it has been a true pleasure working with him.
